# Examples

This section contains examples that are designed to aid understanding of important concepts of UAVCAN.
The examples are not based on any existing UAVCAN implementation, but are completely standalone featuring
zero third-party dependencies.
Examples for the existing implementations can be found in the relevant parts of the documentation.

Unless explicitly noted otherwise, all example code in this section is in public domain.
