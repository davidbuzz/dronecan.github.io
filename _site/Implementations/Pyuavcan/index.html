<h1 id="pyuavcan">Pyuavcan</h1>

<p>Pyuavcan is an implementation of UAVCAN stack in <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, supporting SLCAN and SocketCAN adapters.
It is compatible with Python <strong>2.7</strong> (legacy) and <strong>3.3+</strong> (recommended).
We strongly recommend to use Python 3, because support for Python 2.7 may be dropped in the future.</p>

<p>The latest version of pyuavcan can be installed using pip:</p>
