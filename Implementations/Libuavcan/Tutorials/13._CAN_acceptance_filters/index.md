# CAN acceptance filters

One of the most significant features of a CAN protocol controller is the acceptance filtering capability. Most of CAN 
implementations provide some hardware acceptance filters to relieve the microcontroller from the task of filtering 
those messages which are needed from those which are not of interest.

You can read more about CAN hardware acceptance filters in
[this article](http://www.inp.nsk.su/~kozak/canbus/canimpl.pdf), page 25-28.

## Operation principle

Diagram below shows how hardware acceptance filters work within CAN protocol:

## Example

### Publisher/Client node

This application will be constantly sending messages and service requests to the subscriber/server node (below).
It will help to better understand how hardware acceptance filters work and how to properly configure them using
libuavcan.

Put the following code into `publisher_client.cpp`:

```cpp
{% include_relative publisher_client.cpp %}
```

### Subscriber/Server node

This application demonstrates how to configure hardware acceptance filters with libuavcan.

Put the following code into `subscriber_server.cpp`:

```cpp
{% include_relative subscriber_server.cpp %}
```

## Running on Linux

Build the applications using the following CMake script:

```cmake
{% include_relative CMakeLists.txt %}
```
